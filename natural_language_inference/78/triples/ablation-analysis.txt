(Contribution||has||Ablation analysis)
(Ablation analysis||explore||utility)
(utility||of using||character and syntactic embeddings)
(character and syntactic embeddings||found to||helped)
(helped||has||CAFE)
(Ablation analysis||Using||ReLU)
(ReLU||seems to be||worse)
(worse||than||nonlinear FC layers)
(Ablation analysis||replace||LSTM encoder)
(LSTM encoder||with||BiLSTM)
(LSTM encoder||observing||adding bi-directionality)
(adding bi-directionality||has||did not improve)
(did not improve||has||performance)
(performance||for||our model)
(Ablation analysis||has||1 - layer linear setting)
(1 - layer linear setting||performs||best)
(Ablation analysis||remove||inter-attention alignment features)
(inter-attention alignment features||has||naturally impact)
(naturally impact||has||model performance)
(model performance||has||significantly)
(Ablation analysis||observe||Sub and Concat compositions)
(Sub and Concat compositions||were||more important)
(more important||than||Mul composition)
(Ablation analysis||observe||both highway layers)
(both highway layers||have||marginally helped)
(marginally helped||has||over all performance)
