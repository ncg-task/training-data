(Approach||has||MCFA)
(MCFA||computes||two sentence usability metrics)
(two sentence usability metrics||to control||noise when fixing vectors)
(two sentence usability metrics||has||relative usability)
(relative usability||weighs||confidence of)
(confidence of||using||sentence a)
(sentence a||fixing||sentence b)
(two sentence usability metrics||has||self usability)
(self usability||weighs||confidence)
(confidence||of using||sentence a)
(sentence a||in solving||task)
(MCFA||moves||vectors)
(vectors||preserves||meaning)
(meaning||of||vector dimensions)
(vectors||inside||same space)
(MCFA||is||series of modules)
(series of modules||uses||all the sentence vectors)
(all the sentence vectors||as||context)
(all the sentence vectors||to fix||a sentence vector)
(MCFA||attached after||encoding the sentence)
(encoding the sentence||makes it widely adaptable||to other models)
(Approach||present||neural attentionbased multiple context fixing attachment ( MCFA ))
(Approach||propose||method)
(method||to mitigate||possible problems)
(possible problems||when using||translated sentences)
(translated sentences||as||context)
(Approach||propose||usage of translations)
(usage of translations||as||compelling and effective domain - free contexts)
