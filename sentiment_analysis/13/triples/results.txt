(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||found that||vanilla pre-trained weights)
(vanilla pre-trained weights||of||BERT)
(BERT||do not work||well)
(well||for||review - based tasks)
(Results||noticed that||roles)
(roles||of||domain knowledge and task knowledge)
(domain knowledge and task knowledge||vary for||different tasks and domains)
(Results||For||ASC)
(ASC||observed that||large - scale annotated MRC data)
(large - scale annotated MRC data||is||very useful)
(Results||For||RRC)
(RRC||found that||performance gain)
(performance gain||of||BERT - PT)
(BERT - PT||mostly comes from||task - awareness ( MRC ) post -training)
(Results||For||AE)
(AE||found that||great performance boost)
(great performance boost||comes mostly from||domain knowledge posttraining)
(AE||has||errors)
(errors||mostly come from||annotation inconsistency)
(errors||mostly come from||boundaries)
(boundaries||of||aspects)
(Results||has||BERT - MRC)
(BERT - MRC||has almost no||improvement)
(improvement||on||restaurant)
(Results||has||ASC)
(ASC||tends to have||errors)
(errors||as||decision boundary)
(decision boundary||between||negative and neutral examples)
(negative and neutral examples||is||unclear)
(Results||has||errors)
(errors||on||RRC)
(RRC||come from||incorrect location)
(incorrect location||of||spans)
(spans||that may have||certain nearby words)
(certain nearby words||related to||question)
(RRC||come from||boundaries)
(boundaries||of||spans)
(spans||that are not||concise enough)
(Results||further investigated||BERT - MRC)
(BERT - MRC||improved||examples)
(examples||found that||boundaries of spans ( especially short spans ))
(boundaries of spans ( especially short spans )||were||greatly improved)
(Results||observed||proposed joint post - training ( BERT - PT ))
(proposed joint post - training ( BERT - PT )||has||best performance)
(best performance||over||all tasks)
(all tasks||in||all domains)
(best performance||show||benefits)
(benefits||of having||two types of knowledge)
