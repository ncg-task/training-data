(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||has||integrated full model over all)
(integrated full model over all||achieves||best performance)
(best performance||compared to using||only one of the two proposed approaches)
(Results||has||our best model)
(our best model||achieves||competitive results)
(competitive results||on||D1 and D2)
(D1 and D2||without relying on||so many manually - designed features and external resources)
(Results||has||proposed target representation)
(proposed target representation||is||more helpful)
(more helpful||than||laptop domain ( D2 ))
(more helpful||on||restaurant domain ( D1 , D3 , and D4 ))
(Results||Compared with||LSTM + ATT)
(LSTM + ATT||has||all three settings)
(all three settings||of||our model)
(our model||are able to achieve||statistically significant improvements ( p < 0.05 ))
(statistically significant improvements ( p < 0.05 )||on||all datasets)
(Results||Compared with||all other neural baselines)
(all other neural baselines||has||our full model)
(our full model||achieves||statistically significant improvements ( p < 0.05 ))
