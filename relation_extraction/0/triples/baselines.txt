(Contribution||has||Baselines)
(Baselines||has||feature - based structured perceptron model)
(feature - based structured perceptron model||employ||segment - based decoder)
(segment - based decoder||instead of||token - based decoding)
(feature - based structured perceptron model||with||efficient beam - search)
(Baselines||has||SPTree)
(SPTree||proposed||LSTM - based model)
(LSTM - based model||with||sequence layer)
(sequence layer||for||entity identification)
(LSTM - based model||with||tree - based dependency layer)
(tree - based dependency layer||which identifies||relations between pairs of candidate entities)
(Baselines||employed||our previous approach)
(our previous approach||for||extraction)
(extraction||of||opinion entities and relations)
(opinion entities and relations||to||this task)
