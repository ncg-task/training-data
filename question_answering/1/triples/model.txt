(Contribution||has||Model)
(Model||introduce||Bi- Directional Attention Flow ( BIDAF ) network)
(Bi- Directional Attention Flow ( BIDAF ) network||has||hierarchical multi-stage architecture)
(hierarchical multi-stage architecture||for modeling||representations)
(representations||at||different levels of granularity)
(representations||of||context paragraph)
(Model||use||attention mechanisms)
(attention mechanisms||in||both directions)
(both directions||which provide||complimentary information)
(complimentary information||to||each other)
(both directions||name||query - to - context)
(both directions||name||context - to - query)
(Model||use||memory - less attention mechanism)
(memory - less attention mechanism||allows||attention)
(attention||at||each time step)
(each time step||to be||unaffected)
(unaffected||from||incorrect attendances)
(incorrect attendances||at||previous time steps)
(memory - less attention mechanism||forces||attention layer)
(attention layer||to focus on||learning)
(learning||has||attention)
(attention||between||query and the context)
(memory - less attention mechanism||enables||modeling layer)
(modeling layer||to focus on||learning)
(learning||has||interaction)
(interaction||within||query - aware context representation)
(Model||has||BIDAF)
(BIDAF||includes||character - level , word - level , and contextual embeddings)
(BIDAF||uses||bi-directional attention flow)
(bi-directional attention flow||to obtain||query - aware context representation)
(Model||has||attention)
(attention||has||attended vector)
(attended vector||allowed to||flow through)
(flow through||to||subsequent modeling layer)
(attended vector||at||each time step)
(attention||computed for||every time step)
