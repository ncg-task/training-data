(Contribution||has||Results)
(Results||has||Number of speaker encoder training speakers)
(Number of speaker encoder training speakers||improve significantly||both naturalness and similarity)
(both naturalness and similarity||As||increases)
(increases||has||number of training speakers)
(Results||has||Speech naturalness)
(Speech naturalness||has||MOS on unseen speakers)
(MOS on unseen speakers||is higher than||seen speakers)
(seen speakers||by as much as||0.2 points)
(0.2 points||on||LibriSpeech)
(Speech naturalness||has||audio generated)
(audio generated||for||unseen speakers)
(unseen speakers||is deemed to be at least as natural as||generated for seen speakers)
(Speech naturalness||has||proposed model)
(proposed model||achieved||about 4.0 MOS)
(about 4.0 MOS||in||all datasets)
(Results||has||Speaker embedding space)
(Speaker embedding space||has||PCA visualization)
(PCA visualization||shows||synthesized utterances)
(synthesized utterances||tend to lie very close to||real speech from the same speaker)
(real speech from the same speaker||in||embedding space)
(Speaker embedding space||has||t - SNE visualization)
